# Clicky-Game
# Overview
This is a fun, challenging  memory game I built using React. 

# Memory game

The app keeps track of the player's current score and their high score. The player's score increments when clicking an image for the first time. The player's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle in a random order to challenge the memory of the player.

Once the player's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
